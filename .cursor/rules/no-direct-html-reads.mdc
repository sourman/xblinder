# Rule: No Direct Modal Or HTML Reads

## Summary
Please do not read the modal file or HTML files directly. Always open a terminal and use Python (inline or otherwise) to inspect them with the appropriate tools.

## Guidance
- Use terminal-based Python scripts or REPLs to inspect modal or HTML content when necessary.
- Avoid using file readers or editors to open modal or HTML files directly.
- Prefer exploratory commands that respect this rule when working with modal or HTML assets.
